# NAME
#   awesomemounter.sh - automatically merges directories into a single one
#
# SYNOPSIS
#   awesomemounter.sh [configuration file]
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This script allows to join together many directories into a single (virtual) one.
#
# Quick list of features:
#  - Any number of directories is supported (want 15 directories? no prob!)
#  - Plug-n-play is supported through inotify (e.g. an external usb pendrive)
#  - Any filesystem is supported (e.g. ext3, vfat...)
#
# Configuration must be passed in a file (default path: ~/.awesomemounter/config
#
# When writing, singles files will go to the directory with the most free space,
# so it effectively storage-balances all the involved partitions.
# This allows to simply plug a new drive when you run out of space in existing ones.
# Existing drives can also be unmounted at any time.
# 
#
# REAL WORLD EXAMPLE:
# Premises:
#
# You have 3 directories you want to "merge":
#  - /media/pendrive/music (contains reggae and pop)
#  - /home/mldonkey/music (contains metal and pop)
#  - /mnt/windows/mydocs/music (contains hiphop)
#
# You want all those directories merged seamlessly, in a single place:
#  - /home/foo/music (should contain reggae, metal, pop and hiphop)
# 
# You do not always have the pendrive plugged in.
# Nor do is the windows partition always mounted.
# Which is fine, actually, because AwesomeMounter will take care of it all!
#
# Just add the following line to your config file:
# /home/foo/music  /media/pendrive/music,/home/mldonkey/music,/mnt/windows/mydocs/music
#
# And then just run this very script.
# AwesomeMounter will then keep an eye on mounted systems, and make sure
# everything works accordingly.
